## Face Recognition and Detection using Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of face recognition and detection using Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces algorithms. The initial implementation is based on the Yale Face Database, but there are plans to transition to a custom dataset collected from 4th-year students in the AI department at AAiT (Addis Ababa Institute of Technology). Please note that this transition is an ongoing process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

```

As of now, the implementation uses the Yale Face Database. However, we are actively collecting a new dataset from 4th-year students in the AI department at AAiT. The dataset will be incorporated into the project once the collection process is complete.
